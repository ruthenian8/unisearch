# Unisearch

## overview
The program crawls all links from a given webpage.
The deepness of crawling is 1, e.g. it is required that each link contains a part of the corpus to build.
After building the corpus is done, fulltext search
can be performed via the API.
The pages to parse are assumed to have their text wrapped in p-tags.
Primary target is lib.ru or static news pages.
